Work in progress for FreeBSD on Zynq UltraScale+ (zynqmp).
==========================================================

These drivers are in various states of maturity.  Use at your own risk.

Directories:

diff/	- patches needed to /usr/src.  At the moment, only sys/conf/files.arm64
	  needs to include the driver files.

xilinx/	- drivers.  These files belong in sys/arm64/xilinx.

	zynqmp_clk.c	- clock infrastructure driver.
	zynqmp_dp.c	- Display Port driver.  Only supports 1920x1080.
	zynqmp_dpdma.c	- Display Port DMA driver.
	zynqmp_fpga.c	- PL device configuration, allows FPGA programming
	zynqmp_gpio.c	- GPIO driver
	zynqmp_phy.c	- SERDES PHY driver, needed by display port driver.
	zynqmp_phy.h
	zynqmp_pm.c	- Platform Management driver, talks to both firmware
	zynqmp_pm.h	  running at EL3 on ARM and power and clock management
			  firmware running on MicroBlaze PMU (Platform
			  Management Unit).  FPGA and clock drivers depend on
			  this.
	zynqmp_rst.c	- Skeleton reset driver.  Does nothing for now.
	zynqmp_usb.c	- A minimal driver for a few zynq-specific registers
			  and a container for the dwc3 USB 3.0 driver.


dts/	- device tree sources.  I am moving towards using "GNU" upstream
	  DTS files (from https://github.com/xilinx/linux-xlnx) and away
	  from these.  In these dts sources are some work-arounds to allow
	  a GENERIC kernel to boot on the Ultra-96.

Also, an update to the if_cgem.c driver to support gigabit ethernet on the
Zynq UltraScale+ is up for review at https://reviews.freebsd.org/D24304  and
should land in the source soon.
